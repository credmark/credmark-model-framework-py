# API Gateway

The Credmark Framework provides access to remote models and access to on-chain data via [Credmark API Gateway](https://gateway.credmark.com/api/).

## Interactive HTTP requests

If you go to the popup in the top right of the window you can now choose between the different model groups:

- [Credmark Models](https://gateway.credmark.com/api/?urls.primaryName=Credmark%20Models)
- [Utility Models](https://gateway.credmark.com/api/?urls.primaryName=Utility%20Models)
- [Contributor Models](https://gateway.credmark.com/api/?urls.primaryName=Contributor%20Models)
- [Example Models](https://gateway.credmark.com/api/?urls.primaryName=Example%20Models)

For each group, you will get the docs for all the models within the group and you are able to run them interactively. Note that not all models are fully documented yet.
